# SQLalchemy ORM and Flask app project

## SQLalchemy Object Relational Mapper

**In this project I used SQLalchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of surf stations in Hawaii.**

**After importing the Python toolkit necessary for SQL Object Relational Mapper, an engine was created to open and reflect the dataset into Python classes.**

# 

**Once the dataset is reflected I was able to start querying the requirement analysis and create a DataFrame using Pandas.**

**Considering the most active surf station in Hawaii this histogram chart can answer what is the average climate temperature between Aug-2016 and Aug-2017.**

## Flask app

**Using Flask I was able to create a webpage that is connected to SQL to demonstrate some analysis that was done previously. Under are all the web pages available in this Flask project:**

# 

**The last webpage allows you to insert a start and end date to check the max, min and average temperature between these specific periods.**

*The range of dates is between 2010-01-01 to 2017-08-23*
