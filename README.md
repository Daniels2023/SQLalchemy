# SQLalchemy ORM and Flask app project

##SQLalchemy Object Relational Mapper

**In this project I used SQLalchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of surf stations in Hawaii.

**After importing the Python toolkit necessary for SQL Object Relational Mapper, an engine was created to open and reflect the dataset into Python classes.

**Once the dataset is reflected I was able to start querying the requirements analysis and create a DataFrame using Pandas.

**Considering the most active surf station in Hawaii we could answer what is the average climate temperature.
